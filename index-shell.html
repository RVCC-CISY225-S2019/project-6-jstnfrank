            Refugee Paper    
            </h1>
            
<p> People sometimes fail to see the struggles of a refugee even before showing up to these foreign countries. It's no secret that refugees have it rough when they move from their homes to come to a new foreign land where even the language is different.  The life and experiences of a refugee can be very traumatic but is a trauma that for some have no choice but to face. A refugee is a person who is forced to leave their country in order to seek a safer way of life somewhere else, this demonstrates how people are forced to leave the homes they love because it is no longer safe enough to stay there.  Warsan Shire describes the struggles of a refugee in her poem titled "Home" where she explains the reasons why refugees are forced to leave their homes and their struggles just to leave. Sarah Kenyon Lischer also touches upon this subject in her article titled "Causes and Consequences of Conflict-Induced Displacement" where she discusses the causes and consequences of refugee displacement. The life of a refugee is traumatic because they are forced to leave their homes, they face the hardships of the journey to a new land, and finally they face discrimination.  </p>

 

<p> First and foremost, readers need to understand the reasons for refugees are forced out of their homes. They have to make the horrible choice of either to stay somewhere where it is no longer safe for them or move out to seek a new home.  That alone must be a devastating thing to go through where you have to leave the place you call home in order to find safety somewhere else. There are unfortunately many reasons for refugees to be forced out of their homes and warsan discusses this in her poem. Warsen States "One prison Guard in the night is better than a truckload of men who look like your father." (Shire, line 41-44.)  This quote demonstrates how for woman would rather be taken into a prison of a foreign land because they feel like that is safer than be to be taken and raped by men in trucks in their own countries. The men in trucks are usually rebel groups who terrorize civilians because they want to take over their government by force. While it is important for readers to understand the already traumatic experience of being forced out of your homes due to the lack of safety, readers also need to understand the significance of their being lots of reasons for a refugee to flee their homes. 
            </p>
 

<p> Furthermore, there are many reasons as to why refugees are forced out of their homes like having a weak government, civil war, natural disasters, etc. Now due to a weak government a country could have international conflict that could lead to a mass migration displacing refugees. That in itself is also a horrible thing to see, your home country having conflict with other countries and for the conflict to be so bad that it forces people to move due to the fear of no longer being or feeling safe. Sarah explains in her article that although civil war is a primary cause for refugee displacement, international conflict also can play a huge role. She states " Historical Experience and the threat of overwhelming refugee flow encourages Governments and International Organizations to consider the potential displacements effects of international conflict." (Lischer, Pg. 147.) This quote portrays how no even Governments and International Organizations should now take into consideration of the effects that their problems could have on the refugees that will be affected by it.  This is also another of many reasons as to why people are forced out. Other countries are taken over by groups of anarchy and those groups cause harm to their home towns and cities. Natual disasters can also destroy the homes of many people forcing them to evacuate.  
            </p>
<p> Secondly, the journey that a refugee has to endure is no walk in the park, they face many hardships in their journeys always keeping in mind that they need to find safety. Refugees are sometimes forced to travel great distances mostly on foot in order to escape the hardships of their once homes. The worst part must be that while they are fleeing they are always keeping the fact that their homes that they have lived and loved for years is no longer safe for them to be around on the top of their heads. They wonder things like "what went wrong" or "when did things get so bad". Shire speaks on this subject in her poem where she states "home is the mouth of a shark, home is the barrel of the gun and no one would leave home unless home chased you to the shore, unless home told you to quicken your legs, leave your clothes behind, crawl through the desert, wade through the oceans, drown, save, be hunger, beg, forget pride, your survival is more important" (Shire, lines 74-88.) This quote demonstrates some of the hardships that refugees endure during their journeys to new land. They endure deserts and oceans in order to find safety. They are forced out of their homes and journey through these hardships in order to be safe again and start over a new life.  
            </p>
 

<p> Lastly, Refugees face discrimination each step of the way because of where they're from. They are discriminated because of where they are from, how they dress and even because of the language they speak. Unfortunately, when refugees come to new lands the natives of those lands sometimes don’t like new people coming into their home towns and cities. To make matter worse a lot of times refugees are discriminated because they don’t know the culture of their new homes. They are discriminated because of not knowing the native language of their new homes. In the poem "Home" Shire does touch upon this subject where she states "the go home blacks, refugees, dirty immigrants, asylum seekers, sucking our country dry, niggers with their hands out, they smell strange, savage, messed up their country and now they want to mess ours up." (Shire, lines 47-57.) This quote demonstrates the things that people say to the refugees without fully understanding what they just went through just to get to this new land. It must already be traumatic enough to be forced out of your home then enduring a long a horrible journey to new land only to be treated like minorities the second they get there. 
            </p>
<p> Lischer also points out in her article that refugees are sometimes put in the spotlight in front of the eyes of society to be judged and most of the time hated by them. It is one thing for refugees to start showing up but what people don’t like is when lots and lots of refugees start showing up because they fear that these refugees will interfere with the lives of the people who have already been living in the new land. Lischer states " For example a sampling of national headlines warns of a ' Growing stream of refugees' from Sudan, a 'Flood of boat people' trying to reach Australia, and a 'tide of refugees inundating Florida'." (Lischer, Pg.142-143.) This quote portrays how refugees even make headlines in the news as like a warning to other people to look out for the refugees. Usually the public takes these news stories very seriously but unfortunately their reaction isn't always sympathetic instead they choose to make the refugees feel worse than what they already feel. To make things worse the refugees most times can't even fight back to defend themselves, they swallow their pride in order to stay afloat and survive in this foreign land.

<p> In both “Son” by Andrew Solomon and in “The Chinese in All of Us” by Richard Rodriguez write about their lives. Richard Rodriguez he writes about his life, and he also thinks of himself of Chinese which lead to problems. In “Son” by Solomon, it explains the two different kinds of identities vertical identities like the ones that connect us to the members of our families, and the horizontal identities we form on the basis of characteristics.  The ideas from Solomon‘s essay can help readers understand Rodriguez’s short story is the importance of vertical, horizontal identity and school. Also, in “Son”, his parents made an influence on his life in both positive and negative way. Rodriguez has horizontal and vertical identities too.
